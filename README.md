## Nest-React-Vite-Starter

## Why this repo

This repository serves as an ideal starting point for developers looking to build full-stack applications with NestJS and React, particularly when:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) isn't necessary for your project
- You prefer not to use frameworks like Next.js or Remix
- You want a modern development experience with features like:
  - Fast hot reloading
  - End-to-end type safety
  - Modern build system
  - Clean architecture
  - Best practices out of the box
  - ....

Built with React, Vite, and NestJS, this template provides a robust foundation for building scalable full-stack applications while maintaining excellent developer experience.
